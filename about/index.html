    Wikipedia states that Post-Rock music "is a form of experimental rock characterized by a focus on exploring textures and timbre over traditional rock song structures, chords, or riffs." In other words, Post-Rock music uses the
    instrumentation of Rock music but abandons it's traditional structure.
    <p>I'm interested in Post-Rock because it's a genre that constantly pushes boundaries and challenges the listener, while still including some of my favorite aspects of rock music.</p>
